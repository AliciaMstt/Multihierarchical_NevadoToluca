##**Searching and deleting Codon Stops**##

**`Geneious-8.0.2`** Each ASV dataset was aligned in Geneious `(https://www.geneious.com/)`.

**`Geneious-8.0.2`** Each ASV dataset was aligned in Geneious with MAFFT, using the FFT-NS-1 algorithm, a scoring matrix of 200/PAM/K=2, GAP open penalty of 3, and the translation align option `(https://www.geneious.com/)`.

##I prepared the databases in **`GENEOUS`**

#First, I did the alignment with MAFFT under the following parameters: 
-Algoritm: FFT-NS-1.
-Scoring matrix: 200PAM/K=2.
-GAP open Penalty: 3 (the maximum value of this version of geneious).

I searched for **`indels**` and **`insertions**` (blank segments), and removed all sequence.

I searched CODON STOPS following the parameters:
-Nucleotides
-Translation align option.
-FRAME: frame 3 (There are frame 1 and 2, but this options are used until no stop codons are observed).
-Genetic code: Invertebrados Mitochindrial (trans-table5)

#
Finally, I exported each arthropod group to fasta format to use in the next script: **`0.5to_get_ASV_tables.sh**`
