##**ASVs Tables**##

**`usearch-10`** A community table was then generated with read-counts (haplotype abundance) of each retained ASV for the eight orders by matching ASVs against the complete collection of reads (i.e., reads before the dereplicating and denoising steps) using the -search_exact command `(https://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual10/)`.

##Final step after preparing file in geneious
`usearch100 -search_exact all.420.fas  -db All_s2_sinSTOPS_revised.fasta -strand plus -otutabout allele_table_All_s2_sinSTOPS_revised.txt`
